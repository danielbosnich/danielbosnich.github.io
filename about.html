            Hi, my name is Daniel Bosnich and welcome to my personal website!
            <br><br>
            See that guy standing on the rock in the above picture? Wouldn't it be cool if that was me? Well, it's actually just a random guy.
            But I did take that photo while standing on an almost-as-impressive rock; you'll just have to take my word for it.
            <br><br>
            Anyway, this site was originally intended as a professional portfolio but has morphed into more of a fun, creative outlet. Despite being
            a no-nonsense engineer, I'm still very driven by aesthetics. It's not enough for a design to be functional, it has to look good too.
            I've included my professional goals and detailed some of my engineering experience, but the rest will be reserved for personal interests.
            <br><br>
            For work, I am currently a systems engineer at Spectra Logic where I develop a Python package that handles communication
            with our robotics. My career goals are to be in a position where I'm always learning and being challenged and to use
            my engineering skills to make the world a better place, ideally by improving global sustainability.
            <br><br>
            For fun, I love an engrossing book, a strong cup of coffee, and an open weekend morning. I love a breath of (thin) fresh air at
            the top of a fourteen thousand foot mountain. I love watching Barcelona play soccer, and then trying to emulate their style in my own games.
            And I love meeting new people, so if you'd like to connect then shoot me a message!
            <br><br>
            -Daniel
