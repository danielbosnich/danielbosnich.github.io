            Hi! My name is Daniel Bosnich and welcome to my personal website.
            <br><br>
            See that guy standing on the rock in the above picture?  Wouldn't it be cool if that was me?
            Well, it's actually just a random guy. But I did take that photo while standing on an almost-as-impressive rock; you'll just have to take my word for it.
            <br><br>
            Anyways, a bit about me: I work as a Systems Engineer for Spectra Logic in Boulder, Colorado. Outside of work, I really enjoy learning new things and
            exploring new places. I love playing soccer, hiking, biking, and really just being outside. I always have a book or two checked out from the library
            and plan on eventually add a 'Reading' section to this website.
            <br>
