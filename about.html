            Hi, my name is Daniel Bosnich and welcome to my personal website!
            <br><br>
            See that guy standing on the rock in the above picture? Wouldn't it be cool if that was me? Well, it's actually just a random guy.
            But I did take that photo while standing on an almost-as-impressive rock; you'll just have to take my word for it.
            <br><br>
            Anyway, this site was originally intended as a professional portfolio but has morphed into more of a creative outlet. Despite
            being a pragmatic engineer, I still have an eye for aesthetics and have included some of my photography in addition to an
            overview of my engineering background.
            <br><br>
            For work, I am currently a software engineer at Spectra Logic where I write code that automates testing of a software application.
            My career goals are to be in a position where I'm always learning and being challenged and to use my engineering experience to
            make the world a better place, ideally by improving global sustainability.
            <br><br>
            For fun, I love an engrossing book, a strong cup of coffee, and an open weekend morning. I love a breath of (thin) fresh air on top
            of a fourteen thousand foot mountain. I love watching Arsenal play soccer, and then trying to emulate their style in my own games.
            And I love meeting new people, so if you'd like to connect then shoot me a message!
            <br><br>
            -Daniel
