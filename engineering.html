          The above photo is from the test track at the 2016 Shell Eco-Marathon competition in Detroit. We designed and manufactured
          the pictured vehicle and achieved 1,214 miles per gallon, winning 1st place in the ethanol group. Additionally, we received
          the Technical Innovation award for utilizing natural fiber composites in the body of the vehicle (which is why it's that
          brown color). But more on that below, I'll list engineering experience chronologically.

          I've been at Spectra Logic since graduating college in 2016, working in a few different engineering roles and disciplines. I've primarily worked on
          tape libraries like the one pictured above - yes, tape is still in use these days. We sell these large tape libraries to some exciting customers:
          NASA, CERN, and Los Alamos National Lab being just a few.
          <br><br>
          Unfortunately, I probably shouldn't include photos of the robotics we're currently developing or the mechanical pieces I've designed,
          so this section will be a bit more dry. But I'll make up for it in the Senior Design section below.
          <br><br>
          I started out at Spectra Logic in the robotic motion software team testing software builds to ensure quality and verify bug fixes. Even though
          I wasn't developing production code, I enjoyed being part of a software team and being exposed to agile methodologies.
          <br><br>
          I then moved over to manufacturing and worked as a mechanical engineer in the Sustaining group. I supported the manufacturing line by
          determining root cause of test failures and also designed fixtures to improve product manufacturability. However, I continued to be intrigued
          by software development and later started working with the software engineers in Sustaining to fix bugs and implement small features for two
          different Ruby on Rails web applications.
          <br><br>
          Next, I moved into a systems engineering position on the Hardware R&D team that was primarily focused on software development. My main project
          for this group was developing a Python package that handled CAN communication with all tape library devices and robotics. This package was
          used to implement numerous programs for testing new hardware and firmware and was also utilized by the Sustaining team. Additionally, I set up
          a CI process for development, hosted the package on a local PyPI server, and automated deployment of generated API documentation.
          <br><br>
          In September 2021 I moved into my current role as a software engineer on the Test Automation team. I am still working with tape libraries, but
          purely on the software side now - writing code in Go to automate testing of a new software application.
          <br><br>
          I've learned volumes in my time at Spectra Logic - growing in my mechanical engineering experience while also learning programming and
          transitioning to full-time software development. I've had an integral part to play in many important design decisions and testing projects
          which has allowed me to really grow as an engineer.

          The Shell Eco-Marathon is a competition for high school and college student teams to design and build ultra-energy-efficient vehicles. The
          Mechanical Engineering department at CU Boulder coordinated a team as one of the options for our senior capstone project, which I joined along
          with six other students (I'm second from the left in the above photo).
          <br><br>
          Most of the vehicles that achieve the highest fuel efficiency use carbon fiber extensively - it is very lightweight and strong and is perfect
          for this application. However, it is also very energy-intensive to manufacture and greatly increases the embodied energy of the vehicle.
          <br><br>
          We wanted to fully embrace the "eco" aspect of the competition by using natural and biodegradable materials wherever we could. These materials,
          while not as light and rigid, still had impressive mechanical properties, would decrease the embodied energy of our vehicle, and would differentiate
          ourselves from the crowd.

          Building on research done by Dr. Wil Srubar and his group, the natural fiber composite (NFC) material we chose to use was comprised of jute as the
          fiber (commonly used to make burlap) and a mixture of gelatin, water, and tannins as the resin. There was an incredible amount of experimentation,
          material testing, and data analysis required to determine the optimal proportions of water, gelatin, and tannins in the resin and the best coating
          to protect against water damage.
          <br><br>
          In the end we were not able to use NFCs in the chassis as the proposed hybrid chassis had weak points where the necessary aluminum tubes met the
          NFC tubes. However, we were able to successfully mold NFC panels and use them for the body of the vehicle.
          <br><br>
          In April of 2016, we packed up our vehicle into a U-Haul and drove out to Detroit for the Eco-Marathon competition. It was a blast and we enjoyed
          meeting teams from all over the country and from Latin America too. There may have been some last-minute welding in order to pass the safety inspection,
          but on "race" day our vehicle ran great and we were thrilled to bring home two trophies.
