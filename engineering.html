          The above photo is from the test track at the 2016 Shell Eco-Marathon competition in Detroit. We designed and manufactured
          the pictured vehicle and achieved 1,214 miles per gallon, winning 1st place in the ethanol group. Additionally, we received
          the Technical Innovation award for utilizing natural fiber composites in the body of the vehicle (which is why it's that weird
          brown color). But more on that below, I'll list engineering experience chronologically.

          I've worked at Spectra Logic for the past 5 years in a number of different engineering roles and disciplines. I've primarily worked on
          tape libraries like the one pictured above, which we sell to some exciting customers: NASA, CERN, and Los Alamos National Lab being just a few.
          <br><br>
          Unfortunately, I probably shouldn't include photos of the mechanical pieces I've designed or testing I've done, so this section will be a bit more dry.
          But I'll make up for it in the Senior Design section below.
          <br><br>
          I've learned volumes in my time at Spectra Logic - growing in my mechanical engineering skills while also learning programming and eventually
          transitioning to full-time software development. I've had an integral part to play in many important design and testing decisions and have really
          grown as an engineer because of that.

          The Shell Eco-Marathon is a competition for high school and college student teams to build ultra-efficient vehicles and compete at the end
          of the school year. The Mechanical Engineering department at CU Boulder coordinated a team as part of the senior design program to compete
          in this competition, and I was a part of this team along with six other students (I'm second from the left in the above photo).

          Most of the vehicles that achieve the highest fuel efficiency make great use of carbon fiber throughout the vehicle. It is a very lightweight
          and strong material and is perfect for this application. However, it is also very energy-intensive to manufacture and its use greatly increases
          the embodied energy of the vehicle.
          <br><br>
          We wanted to take the "eco" aspect of the competition and run with it by using natural and biodegradable materials wherever we could. These materials,
          while not as light and rigid, still had impressive mechanical properties, would decrease the embodied energy of our vehicle, and would differentiate
          ourselves from the crowd.

          Building on some research done by Dr. Wil Srubar and his group, the natural fiber composite (NFC) material we chose to use was comprised of jute as the
          fiber (commonly used to make burlap) and a mixture of gelatin, water, and tannins as the resin. There was an incredible amount of experimentation,
          material testing, and data anlysis required to determine the optimal proportions of water, gelatin, and tannins in the resin and the best coating
          to protect against water damage.
          <br><br>
          In the end we were not able to use NFCs in the chassis as the proposed hybrid chassis had weak points where the necessary aluminum tubes met the
          NFC tubes. However, we were able to successfully mold panels and use them for the vehicle body.

          In April of 2016, we packed up our vehicle into a U-Haul and drove out to Detroit for the Eco-Marathon competition. It was a blast and we enjoyed
          meeting teams from all over the country and from Latin America too. There might have been some last-minute welding, but in end the vehicle ran great
          and we were thrilled to also win the Technical Innovation award.
